# update-hosted-feature-service

This Python script turns an MXD into a service definition (SD) file. Your ArcGIS.com account is searched for a matching service. The SD file is uploaded to your ArcGIS.com account, the existing service is deleted, and the uploaded SD file is published. 
See more information on the [associated ArcGIS Blog post](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/01/22/
updating-your-hosted-feature-service-–-version-2/).
